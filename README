poloka-simphot
==============

poloka is a software package to process astronomical
images. poloka-simphot is a photometry for variable sources module
of the poloka suite. It will try to do forward modeling of a pixelated
background and a point source simulteanously to all images. It will
compute geometrical transformation together with a kernel to match a
reference point spread function as an operator to apply without any
resampling (contrary to poloka-lc module).

To install poloka-simphot, see the INSTALL file.
